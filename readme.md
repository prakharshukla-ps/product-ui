# Product UI

This project demonstrates a responsive product selection user interface built using pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features dynamic pricing, smooth animations for element visibility, client-side form validation.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** Adapts to various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop).

- **Dynamic Unit Selection:** Users can select different product units (1, 2, or 3 units), with prices and discounts updating accordingly.

- **Conditional Options Display:** Size and color dropdowns for each unit are only displayed when that specific unit option is selected.

- **Smooth Animations:**

  - Unit option cards fade in and slide up on page load for a pleasant entrance effect.

  - Dropdown sections smoothly expand and collapse when unit options are selected.

  - "Add to Cart" button includes hover and click animations.

- **Client-Side Form Validation:** Ensures all required size and color options are selected before an item can be added to the cart.

- **"Add to Cart" Confirmation:** A non-intrusive message appears briefly to confirm items have been added to the cart.
